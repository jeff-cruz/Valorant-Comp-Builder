# valorant-comp-builder

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project for Valorant gamers to build their own team composition of Valorant agents.

As a Valorant player, I wanted to build my first project relating to Valorant that updates as new Valorant agents are released, look into agents background and to be able to make team comps.
